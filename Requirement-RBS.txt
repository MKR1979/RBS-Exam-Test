Scenario :-

The contents of a remote data source are required to be displayed in a user friendly, interactive, and visually appealing manner.

We are interested in your approach to the solution and the design decisions that you make.

As a reference, the solution will probably take a few hours to implement.
 

Requirements :-

Design and code a React.js application to display the remote data in a tabular format, using any additional libraries you want to leverage.

Each record in the table needs to contain the ‘num’, ‘name’ and ‘type’ properties.

Each record in the table needs to display the associated image.

The table data is to be ordered alphabetically on the ‘name’ property, in ascending order.

When a user clicks on a table row, the application needs to provide them with additional information on the selected entry, e.g. the previous and next evolutions.
 

Optional Extras :-

Additional table functionality, e.g. search, ordering of columns

Anything else you’d like to include that would be of benefit

Return :-

Solutions should be returned via a link to a version available on the Web, e.g. GitHub, Dropbox, etc. (attachments are unlikely to get through the firewall).
